An open-source terminal command/script launcher

## Getting started

This simple menubar application will let you run terminal commands or script using the menubar.
If the command script requires sudo it will be autodetected and you will be asked to enter administrator password.

On the first run the menubar may look a little bit empty.

When you hit **Edit menus** you'll be presented 10 tabs which you can use to enter up to 10 commands under each tab or just one command for each tab which creates single menu entry.
